# Expense_tracker_api

REST API for tracking expenses.

A RESTful API created using Spring Boot. Use of PostgreSQL as the relational database and JdbcTemplate to interact with. Apart from this, use of JSON Web Token (JWT) to add authentication. Using JWT, we can protect certain endpoints and ensure that user must be logged-in to access information.
